### About me:
I am a practicing cardiac surgeon. Since 2010, I started to get involved in creating primitive sites using only HTML in CSS.
While studying at the medical university, I continued my hobby, and in 2012 I started learning PHP.

In 2016, I was selected for an internship at INTEXSOFT, which I could not complete, because. chose medicine.
Having been doing freelancing for the past few years, I decided to change direction and move from practical medicine to programming.

I hope that my ability to absorb large amounts of information will help me become a good Frontend developer.
